# QuickSort

In place sorting of an array without the need for extra storage allocation.
Follows the conventional algorithmic approach with worst case: O(n^2) and best case: O(NlogN)

Advantages: Fastest sorting algorithm on average, and doesnt need additional memory
Disadvantages: Worst case is of O(n^2), which is relatively slow

# MergeSort

Implementation of Merrge Sort, requires extra storage allocation since it is not in place.

Advantages: Guaranteed running time, at worst best and average: O(NlogN)
Disadvantages: Additional memory costs
